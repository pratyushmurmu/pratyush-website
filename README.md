# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Hi! 👋  
This is my **personal portfolio website**, built from scratch as my **first independent web development project**.  
It represents my learning journey, my interests, and the skills I’m currently developing as a Computer Science undergraduate.

## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio was created to:
- Practice and apply my frontend web development skills
- Learn how to structure a real website from start to finish
- Understand responsiveness and basic user experience
- Have a single place to showcase my work and progress

While building this project, I explored real-world problems like layout issues, mobile responsiveness, and navigation behavior, and learned how to debug and improve my code step by step.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure and content  
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity (hamburger menu, basic UI behavior)

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned:
- How to build a website layout from scratch
- Using Flexbox and Grid for layouts
- Making a website responsive using media queries
- Adding interactivity with JavaScript
- Debugging issues related to DOM loading and responsiveness
- How small UI/UX details improve user experience

I also learned the importance of using tools and resources (documentation, online references, and AI tools) **to learn effectively**, not just to copy code.
